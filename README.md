# CrystalCompiler

This is a compiler of a language we invented, named "Crystal".
We developed this project in the context of a Languages & Compilers course at the Polytechnic School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo.
The compiled code can be run in a virtual Von Neumann machine designed by the school's department of Computer Engineering.

Some exemple of code written in the Crystal language are provided (files with .cry extension).
